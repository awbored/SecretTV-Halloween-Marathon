We should know and understand that the history behind Thanksgiving is darker than what Americans were taught, with the myth of Native Americans and Pilgrims having a 'friendly meal' together, helping each other during winter.  This was very much not true.  The people that lived on this land were wiped out, extensively, by colonizers.  We should acknowledge and mourn this fact.

I encourage you to check the site [Native-Land](https://native-land.ca/about/why-it-matters/) to find the Indigenous people that lived in your area, learn about their history, and share what you have learned.

We can entirely change our definition of Thanksgiving with this information by celebrating togetherness with friends and family, and mourning the past.

Running the Thanksgiving Macy's Day Parades and other TV specials on Thanksgiving has become a tradition here on SecretTV.  For many that grew up during this time, these videos are a nostalgia trip.  For those that didn't, this provides an interesting look of the very near past.  Have fun!  Be kind!  Love one another!  Learn from each other!  And pass me some pie!

## Info about SecretTVBot

A public version of SecretTVBot is available on the [PyTwitchBot Repo](https://github.com/awbored/PyTwitchBot) which is written in Python.  The initial nuts and bolts of the programming was from a YouTube video which I have credited in the code.
