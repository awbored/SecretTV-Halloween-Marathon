## Info about SecretTVBot

A public version of SecretTVBot is available on the [PyTwitchBot Repo](https://github.com/awbored/PyTwitchBot) which is written in Python.  The initial nuts and bolts of the programming was from a YouTube video which I have credited in the code.

I wanted to make a Twitch bot from scratch instead of using common other bots out there, like NightBot or StreamElements, mainly so I could learn how the bot interacts with chats and also make custom commands that the other bots might not be able to.  The best way to get into programming and scripting I've found is to have a project idea to build off of.

The main commands I'll list here will be:

 - !about - Information on today's show, which usually has a link to this page if I'm running TV
 - !help/!commands - List the initial commands available
 - !secret - Lists the secret commands

I will sometimes add or change commands on a whim so check these commands first.

The commands I like to brag about are:

 - !random [x] - x = number.  This will dump a random number of emotes to the chat
 - !art - Is what we're watching high art or definitely nart (not art)?  Let the bot decide
 - !reverse [sentence] - this will reverse anything you write after the command
 - !cres [blank/person/thing] - Crescent Fresh decider.  If no entry is after the command then the bot will determine if YOU are crescent fresh.  Anything you write AFTER the command the bot will determine if it's crescent fresh or not
 - !fun [blank/person] - The bot will pull a random adjective from the internet and determine the percentage of fun you're having that day.  If blank it will choose YOUR fun.  If anything is written after the command THAT is the object that has fun.  So you can give fun to other people.  This was made for the fun raid train.
