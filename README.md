# 2023/10/31 - SecretTV Playlist 游꾺游꾺游꾺

We've curated over 40 hours of content here!  (Wow! Holy shit!)  The marathon will run from Monday morning until Wednesday morning when I have to sign into work.  The playlist will LOOP.  I will monitor the chat as best as I can, but really I may be away from the keyboard often, as I still have a job to do, errands to run, and cats to feed, etc, etc.  

I hope you all have a great Halloween and thank you so much for letting me be a part of your holiday! 游비游둯游비游둯游비游둯游비游둯游비游둯

## Info about SecretTVBot

A public version of SecretTVBot is available on the [PyTwitchBot Repo](https://github.com/awbored/PyTwitchBot) which is written in Python.  The initial nuts and bolts of the programming was from a YouTube video which I have credited in the code.
