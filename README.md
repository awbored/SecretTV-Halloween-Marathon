# 2023/07/04 - SecretTV "Secret July 4th America Sucks Marathon" Playlist

Hi all!  I will be taking a break from Twitch streams while I prepare for my August tour in the Northeast.  Tour dates and info are on my [website](https://andrewway.net) so come out and say hi if you're in the area.  As a sort of 'farewell for now' I am running SecretTV in marathon mode all day on July 4th.  I may be away from the keyboard at various times of the day but I will check in often and say hi when I get a chance to.

The break will be from July through August.  I will pop up with a few Secret TV or Synth shows when I feel the bug to do so.  Like, July 21st I will still be part of a raid train to help padjray fund a wheelchair.

On a note on the holiday, it is honestly very difficult to be excited about America right now.  We're battling homelessness daily as the cost of living continues to go up.  Police keep getting funded when they do nothing.  And the supreme court and various states continue to create bills, essentially making it illegal for our friends and family to simply EXIST and receive the care they need!

Trans lives exist!  Trans lives matter!

I have set a !charity goal of $1000 for the [Transgender Law Center](https://transgenderlawcenter.org/).

Today's playlist is a mixture of VHS tapes with July 4th themes and other fun things that have been on SecretTV in the past.  Thanks for hanging out!  Please be cool to one another!  Thank you for your support.  I love you all.

## Info about SecretTVBot

A public version of SecretTVBot is available on the [PyTwitchBot Repo](https://github.com/awbored/PyTwitchBot) which is written in Python.  The initial nuts and bolts of the programming was from a YouTube video which I have credited in the code.

I wanted to make a Twitch bot from scratch instead of using common other bots out there, like NightBot or StreamElements, mainly so I could learn how the bot interacts with chats and also make custom commands that the other bots might not be able to.  The best way to get into programming and scripting I've found is to have a project idea to build off of.

The main commands I'll list here will be:

 - !about - Information on today's show, which usually has a link to this page if I'm running TV
 - !help/!commands - List the initial commands available
 - !secret - Lists the secret commands

I will sometimes add or change commands on a whim so check these commands first.

The commands I like to brag about are:

 - !random [x] - x = number.  This will dump a random number of emotes to the chat
 - !art - Is what we're watching high art or definitely nart (not art)?  Let the bot decide
 - !reverse [sentence] - this will reverse anything you write after the command
 - !cres [blank/person/thing] - Crescent Fresh decider.  If no entry is after the command then the bot will determine if YOU are crescent fresh.  Anything you write AFTER the command the bot will determine if it's crescent fresh or not
 - !fun [blank/person] - The bot will pull a random adjective from the internet and determine the percentage of fun you're having that day.  If blank it will choose YOUR fun.  If anything is written after the command THAT is the object that has fun.  So you can give fun to other people.  This was made for the fun raid train.
