Major John Skokes, a prisoner of the aliens, is thrown into a cell, where he encounters another captive - a young female cadet. She reveals that their captors are apparently grafting alien skin onto her body a bit at a time. Skokes tries to escape from their cell through an overhead vent, but his attempt fails at first when he is attacked by something lurking in the vents. Skokes makes a second attempt to escape through the air ducts, but an alien guard severs his hand before Skokes is knocked out. As their situation appears bleak, Skokes attempts to raise his fellow prisoner's spirits by telling her of a top secret plan to launch a sneak attack that might turn the tide of the war. Suddenly, a guard enters the cell, and she willingly leaves, revealing that she is really an alien spy who is actually being slowly transformed back into her original form.  Note: The story concludes in episode 18 of season 2, "The Light Brigade".
